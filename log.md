# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Start Front End Certification from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It's a real struggle on forgetting letters for CSS. Back them my problem was the semi colons. Now letters. It's a fun start. I am only able to do it for 30 mins. I really can't but I hope it gets better.

### Day 0: January 18, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished bootstrap and started with jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I tried again for 30 mins right before I go to bed, you know, hopefully. It's fun and hoping to get a momentum and add five or 10 mins per day of coding.
