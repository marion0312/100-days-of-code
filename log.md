# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Start Front End Certification from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It's a real struggle on forgetting letters for CSS. Back them my problem was the semi colons. Now letters. It's a fun start. I am only able to do it for 30 mins. I really can't but I hope it gets better.

### Day 1: January 18, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished bootstrap and started with jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I tried again for 30 mins right before I go to bed, you know, hopefully. It's fun and hoping to get a momentum and add five or 10 mins per day of coding.

### Day 2: January 19, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery and started in Sass.

**Thoughts:** While jQuery and Bootstrap is easy, Sass on the other hand feels like a whole different alley. It's like JS and CSS combined. Relearning this stuff again is fun. Breaks the ice in me.

### Day 3: January 20, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sass and blew my mind with React.

**Thoughts:** Learning something new is always hard. Maybe I am always full of myself before that I never welcome these new technologies lying around waiting to be learned. They are so handy!

### Day 4: January 21, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Slowly cracking my brain with react.

**Thoughts:** React is a bit difficult to grasp. I really wish I can change this schedule to morning.

### Day 5: January 23, 2021 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Got sidetracked in relearning Git and Github.

**Thoughts:** Things changed since last time I played with Git. of all times.

### Day 6: January 24, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started in ES6 Basics

**Thoughts:** I should have probably started in understanding the bascis. Maybe that's why I am confused in learning ReactJS.

### Day 7: January 25, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learning templated, objects, literals.

**Thoughts:** ES6 helps coders shorten their codes. Short, simple, concise.

### Day 8: January 26, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Saved by the bell. Literally. Added new lessons from freeCodeCamp and stumbled in Export and Import functions as I don't see the html file. It seems there are additional settings for that to work.

**Thoughts:** There are so many things that should have saved time for me only if I learned this thing before. I can see why it is required in learning frameworks.

### Day 9: January 27, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Javascript classes, inheritance, and constructors.

**Thoughts:** JavaScript classes are ES6 features that enters JS to OOP.

### Day 9: January 28, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finished learning classes (basics) and started in Async and Await. Almost done!

**Thoughts:** This might be easy to learn but this are all concepts. All basics. The real challenge awaits in the frameworks.
