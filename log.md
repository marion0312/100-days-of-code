# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 17, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Start Front End Certification from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It's a real struggle on forgetting letters for CSS. Back them my problem was the semi colons. Now letters. It's a fun start. I am only able to do it for 30 mins. I really can't but I hope it gets better.

### Day 1: January 18, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finished bootstrap and started with jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I tried again for 30 mins right before I go to bed, you know, hopefully. It's fun and hoping to get a momentum and add five or 10 mins per day of coding.

### Day 2: January 19, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished jQuery and started in Sass.

**Thoughts:** While jQuery and Bootstrap is easy, Sass on the other hand feels like a whole different alley. It's like JS and CSS combined. Relearning this stuff again is fun. Breaks the ice in me.

### Day 3: January 20, 2021 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sass and blew my mind with React.

**Thoughts:** Learning something new is always hard. Maybe I am always full of myself before that I never welcome these new technologies lying around waiting to be learned. They are so handy!

### Day 4: January 21, 2021 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Slowly cracking my brain with react.

**Thoughts:** React is a bit difficult to grasp. I really wish I can change this schedule to morning.
